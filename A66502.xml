            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE SPEECHES Of Captain <hi>Walcot, Jo. Rouſe,</hi> and <hi>Will. Hone,</hi> On Friday the Twentieth of <hi>July,</hi> 1683.</head>
            <p>CAptain <hi>Thomas Walcot</hi> being drawn to <hi>Tyburn</hi> in one Hurdle, <hi>John Rouſe</hi> and <hi>William Hone</hi> in another, and there put into a Cart, the Reverend Dr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Cartwright,</hi> Dean of <hi>Rippon,</hi> and one of His Majeſties Chaplains in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, with Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the Ordinary of <hi>Newgate,</hi> began to acquaint Captain <hi>Walcot,</hi> That this was the laſt time he had to ſpend in the world, and therefore deſired him to make a good uſe of it, telling him, <hi>That at death leaves him, ſo Judgment will find him;</hi> and earneſtly exhorted him to make an ingenious Diſcovery and Confeſſion of what he knew touching the Conſpiracy and Treaſons of which he had been found guilty, and received Sentence to die.</p>
            <p>To this Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> replyed, That he had ſome Papers in his Pocket, of what he had prepared to ſay in Writing, becauſe his memory was bad; therefore he deſired they might be pulled out, and he would read them.</p>
            <p>Then Dr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> and the Ordinary ſpake to <hi>Hone</hi> and <hi>Rouſe</hi> to the effect before-mentioned, earneſtly deſiring them to confeſs the whole of what they knew; inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſome places of Scripture to them, as <hi>Joſhuab's</hi> advice to <hi>Achan,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>My Son, confeſs, and give glory to God whom you have diſhonoured,</hi> &amp;c. telling them, they would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued their hands in the Blood of a merciful and good Prince who had often pardoned, and gave many Acts of Oblivion and Indemnity to his Subjects; and whoſe Reign hath preſerved the purity of the Proteſtant Religion amongſt us: That we cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy more than we do enjoy: with other good admonitions for them to make cleer Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the truth of what they knew.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Walent</hi> in the mean while was prepared to read his Speech.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> askt him if he could diſcover any more than he had done already.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Walcot.</speaker>
               <p>I've not in the general. I told the King the thing was laid very deep: There was a Gentleman with me laſt night, I told him what I told the King, and that was all: I told him I thought an Act of Indulgence would be very neceſſary, becauſe he had a great many men to take Judgment of. I know not the particulars of the Deſign; but the King hath the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Weſt,</hi> and others that know more than I. I was never in Councel with them, nor never with them above four, five, or half a dozen times.</p>
            </sp>
            <stage>Then looking upon his Paper, he began his Speech as follows.</stage>
            <p>THis great Concourſe of people do not only come here to ſee me dye, but alſo to hear what I ſhall ſay; and becauſe I would not be reproached, and thought to be an Atheiſt when I am gone, I have two or three words to ſpeak for my Religion. I do believe in Three perſons, and one God, and I expect and hope to be ſaved by the Merits and Righteouſneſs of his Son Chriſt Jeſus, without the hope of an advantage by any Merits or Righteouſneſs of my own. And I believe that the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament are the word of God, that <hi>they were not written according to the will of Man, but holy men of God writ them as they were inſpired by the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99753:2"/>
            <p>I believe that theſe Scriptures ought to be the Rule of our Faith, and the method of our Worſhipping of God: I believe that as Chriſt is the head of his Church, ſo he is then Law giver, That it is not in the power of any Council or Conclave of Cardinals, or power upon earth whatſoever, to ſet up the Precepts and Traditions of men, and to make them of equal validity with the word of God. I believe it was not becauſe the Jews rejected and Crucified Chriſt, that he rejected them, but becauſe they rejected his Word; which appears by the Three thouſand that God by one Sermon of <hi>Peters</hi> Converted; they being <hi>prickt in their hearts, and touched in their Conſciences,</hi> cryed out, <hi>Men and Brethren what ſhall we do?</hi> and they were <hi>that day added to the Church.</hi> It was certainly becauſe the Jews rejected the Word and Goſpel of Chriſt, that <hi>the things were hid from their eyes which belonged to their peace.</hi> It is a dreadful thing to reject the Word of God; and it is a dreadful thing to live in a ſinful courſe of life, till God withdraws his <hi>Spirit</hi> from us: For it is ſaid, <hi>it ſhall not always ſtrive with man. Death is the wages of ſin.</hi> I believe had not <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, he and we his poſterity had not dyed. Death is ſaid to be the <hi>King of Terrours,</hi> but it is only ſo to thoſe that are terrifyed with a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying Conſcience, that have the arrows of the Almighty ſticking in them, from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of great guilt, and ſee no hopes of mercy, have no aſſurance of pardon; but thoſe that are Chriſts, he takes away the terror, and horror, and ſting of death; he enables them to ſay with <hi>Paul, To me to live is Chriſt, and to dye is gain:</hi> he enables not only to get <hi>unto</hi> Chriſt, but <hi>into</hi> Chriſt; and ſo they have <hi>Communion and Fellowſhip with the Father and the Son.</hi> It is no hard matter to get the notions of the promiſes of the Goſpel into our heads; but unleſs the Lord is pleaſed to apply them to our hearts, we cannot believe: except we be <hi>in Chriſt as branches in the Vine,</hi> we are not Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. It was the caſe of poor <hi>Francis Spira;</hi> he was certainly a knowing man, but notwithſtanding he had not faith to apply the promiſes. Chriſt hath ſaid, that <hi>he that believes in him, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live; and he that lives and believes in him, ſhall never dye.</hi> So if we be able to apply the promiſes by the Spirit of God, we may have comfort through Faith: but then <hi>Faith is the gift of God,</hi> and <hi>Faith comes by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the Word of God, and receiving it in the love of God.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not be tedious, Mr. Sheriff, I ſhall be very ſhort.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sheriff.</speaker>
               <p>Take your own time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Walcot.</speaker>
               <p>As to the preſent occaſion of my death, I do neither blame the Judges, nor the Jury, nor the Kings Councel: I only blame ſome men that in reality and in truth were deeper concerned, and more engaged than I, that came in as Witneſſes againſt me: who Swore me out of my life to ſave their own, and who for fear they ſhould not do it effectually, contrived that, That I will appeal to you all, whether there be a probability in it or not: for they ſaid that I made it a ſcruple of Conſcience to have a hand in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the King, or to embrue my hands in his blood, but was ſo generous as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Charging his Guards, whilſt others did it, and to the end another might do it. Truly I will appeal to all that know me, whether they believe me ſo much an Idiot, that I ſhould not underſtand it was the ſame thing to engage the Kings Guards, whilſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Killed him, as to Kill him with my own hands. But however, by their Swearing againſt me, they have ſecured their own Lives and Eſtates, and made my Blood the price of theirs. I confeſs I was ſo unfortunate and unhappy, as to be invited by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Rumſey,</hi> (one of the Witneſſes againſt me) to ſome meetings, where ſome things were diſcourſed of, in order to the aſſerting our Liberties and Properties, which we looked upon to be violated and invaded. But it was he, and Mr. <hi>Weſt,</hi> and ſome Gentlemen that are fled, who were the great promoters of thoſe Meetings. I was near a quarter of a year ill of the Gout, and during that time Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> often viſited me, and ſtill his diſcourſe would be, concerning <hi>Lopping the Swo Sparks;</hi> That was the word he uſed, meaning the King and the Duke; and propoſed it might be done at a Play: This was his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſcourſe: for he ſaid, Then they would dye in their Calling: it was his very Expreſſion. He bought Arms to do it with, without any direction of mine; I never ſaw the Arms, nor I never ſaw the men that were to do it: though they ſaid they had fifty imployed to that end. I told ſeveral of them, That the Killing the King would carry ſuch a blemiſh and ſtain with it, as would deſcend to poſterity, that I had Eight Children, that I was loath ſhould be blemiſhed with it: and withal, I was confident the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would revenge his Fathers Blood, if it were but to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99753:2"/>from having any hand in it. Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> preſently told me; that the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> did not refuſe to give an Engagement, that he would not puniſh thoſe that ſhould kill the King.</p>
               <p>And now I deſire to forgive all the World from the very bottom of my heart; and I pray God of his mercy from my heart to forgive them, even Mr. <hi>Shepherd,</hi> who deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me up, who promiſed to carry me into <hi>Holland,</hi> but inſtead of that, he brought me into the condition wherein I now am. I do deſire with all my heart to forgive the Witneſſes, and withal do earneſtly beg that they may be obſerved, that ſome remarks may be ſet upon them, whether <hi>their End be Peace,</hi> and that <hi>they die the common Death of all men.</hi> Certainly, though it be the Law of the Land I ought to die, and the King may juſtly and reaſonably put me to death for being in thoſe Meetings where a War was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated; yet I think theſe men are guilty of my Bloud, that were as deep in as I, and have betrayed me, and taken it away. Then in the next place I beg leave, Mr. Sheriff, to ſpeak one ſhort word of Advice to my Friends, that hath been often given to me, though I was not ſo fortunate and ſo happy as to take it, and that is, That they would neither hear any man ſpeak, nor ſpeak themſelves, that which they would not have repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for there is no ſuch thing as Faith in man to man, whatever there is in man to God: either the Tears of a Wife, or a Family of little helpleſs Children, ſomething or other will tempt and provoke men to betray one another. When God hath a Work to do, he will not want Inſtruments, for he can make them; nor will he want a way to do it, for he can contrive it and bring it to paſs. And I do moſt heartily deſire, and my ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Prayer to the Almighty is, That this may be the laſt Bloud ſpilt upon this account. I know Acts of Indulgence and Mercy in the King would make him much eaſier in his Government, and would make his People ſit much eaſier under it; and that the Lord may encline his heart to Mercy, ought to be the Prayer of every good man. What hath happened, and what hath been the preſent occaſion of our Calamity, I ſuppoſe every man knows; what Provocations have been on the one hand, Fears and Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Jealouſies and Sufferings of the other, I will not intermeddle with, reſolving to uſe my utmoſt endeavour to make that Peace and reconciliation with my God, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to make with man; and to make it my hearty Prayer to the Great God before whom I am in little time to appear, That he would ſtench this Iſſue of Bloud, and find out ſome other way to preſerve theſe Kingdoms in Unity and Peace; to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory of his Great Name, and the eternal Comfort of his People.</p>
               <p>One word, Mr. Sheriff, I deſire leave to ſpeak as to <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe the King preſt it hard upon me, and ſeveral people have been with me about <hi>Ireland,</hi> how far <hi>Ireland</hi> was concerned in this matter. I do aver here, as in the preſence of God, before whom I am now going to appear, That I do not know an Engliſh man nor Proteſtant in <hi>Ireland</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it. What I did know, was onely of one Scotiſh Gentleman in the North; and the King knows it, but he ſays he does not believe it. For they that were concerned, I was never in any of their Councils: I never ſaw any of thoſe Lords, but the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and that was I believe above ſix months ago. I never ſaw nor ſpoke with one Lord, onely my Lord <hi>Howard;</hi> I heard my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> ſay. That they did not value <hi>Ireland,</hi> for it muſt follow <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have not more to ſay, Mr. Sheriff: but truly you will do an act of a great deal of Charity, if you will prevail with the King for an Act of Indulgence and Liberty to his People; I think ſo: and ſo the Lord have mercy upon me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Cartwright.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>You blame them for that which is their Vertue, and not their Crime, That they have been Witneſſes for the King.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Walcot.</speaker>
               <p>I was not for contriving the Death of the King, if you'll believe me.</p>

               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Cartwright.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>You blame them for betraying of you in Contriving the War, upon which the death of the King muſt have followed, if your Treaſon had gone forward, for elſe you could not have defended your ſelf from that Juſtice to which he hath brought you: and therefore for you to lay that as a Crime upon your Witneſſes, is indeed very ſtrange.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Walcot.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I think it was but reaſonable that I ſhould ſuffer that is due from Juſtice, and reaſonable by the Law; but theſe men, they did not come in againſt me till they did it to ſave themſelves.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Better late than never: a man had better ſave his Soul and Body too, than die as now you do, for Crimes that ought to make every good mans heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; and therefore for your blaming them, it was for that which was their duty to do, they have not committed a Crime in that, but a very meritorious act.</p>

               <p>They have revealed it with that aggravating circumſtance, which I think no rational man will be guilty of.</p>

               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Cartwright.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>That circumſtance which you call aggravating, is no aggravation at all: That is rather a mitigation of your Crime, to make them believe that You were tenderer of the Kings perſon than to ſhoot him when he was not armed. But you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs you were conſulting this Crime.</p>

               <p>There were ſeveral Meetings wherein the buſineſs of the Kings life was never ſpoke of.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Walcot.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, Sir, ſince you do preſs me to ſpeak, we were under general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and ſo were thoſe Lords that are likely to ſuffer, as I have heard; they were under general apprehenſions of Popery and Slaveries coming in.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>What ſigne was there of it? you had no Perſecution at all; you were allowed by the Law to meet five in a houſe, beſides thoſe of the Family. It is true, the Conventicles have been diſturbed of late; and I would have you look upon it as a Judgment of God, to bring you to this for forſaking the Church of <hi>England:</hi> You have forſaken Communion with that Church in that way you were inſtructed from your Youth.</p>

               <speaker>Walcot.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, give me leave, for a man to invite a man to a Meeting, to importune him to this Meeting, to be perpetually ſolliciting him, and then to deliver him up to be hanged, as they have done me—</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>It was a Crime to follicits you to thoſe Meetings; but when you were in, it was a Duty in you and in them to reveal it: if God had given you the grace to reveal them, the turn had been theirs which now is yours. And whereas you ſay you cannot excuſe them, that is uncharitable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Walcot.</speaker>
               <p>I do forgive them, and I deſire with all my heart God would forgive them.</p>

               <p>As a man and a Chriſtian, in the firſt place, as God hath made me a Chriſtian through his Grace, that the World may underſtand, that I do not dye as Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> ſaies, an Atheiſt; I do here declare in the preſence of God, and this vaſt number of people, what Faith I dye in: In that very Faith which was once delivered, and in the Belief of that Doctrine which the Church of <hi>England</hi> makes Profeſſion of, and is agreeable to the word of God, being founded upon the Doctrine of the Prophets, and Apoſtles, whereof Jeſus Chriſt is the Corner Stone. There have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry various opinions concerning me, upon the account of the various imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that I have been exerciſed in, both here, and beyond Sea: It has been my lot to fall under ſuch circumſtances, and to fall under ſuch miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Cenſures, upon the account of ſome publick Imployments, that I have been in for the K. and after I returned from <hi>Flanders,</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99753:4"/>of Disbanding, it was almoſt morally impoſſible for ſuch a one in my capacity, to ſtand right in the affections and opinions of all people. When I was imployed in <hi>Flanders,</hi> in the payment of that Army, I was then between 2 Rocks; I will leave it to the Judgment of all ſorts of people, you know the Country, I need not particulariſe, nor reflect upon opinions, and the like. But I having been bred up in <hi>England,</hi> and had that education it pleaſed God to give me, I was not fond of, nor carried off with, that debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery in thoſe times: and ſometimes, more than once or twice, it was my lot that I was like to have been murthered for pleading for, and juſtifying the actions of the King of <hi>England.</hi> Since my return, and being imployed under Sir <hi>Tho. Player,</hi> and ſome others about disbanding, there it came to my Lot, becauſe I could not humour ſome Gentlemen, who neither fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, nor honoured the King (I will not ſay ſo of all, for I know ſome were very worthy Gentlemen, that ſcorn'd any of thoſe actions, which ſome would attempt. There is one worthy Gent. I can ſpeak very honourably of) that ſo they might have their pockets full of money, did not value how the Accounts were ſtated, and at the very ſame time I was under many temptations of handfuls of Guineas in my hand to do ſo and ſo, to cheat the K. and becauſe I would not do that, I was looked upon as a Jeſuit. I did wave all theſe things under thoſe circumſtances. It hath been my lot likewiſe being imployed by Sir <hi>T. P.</hi> and the reſt of the Commiſſioners to fall into thoſe Companies and places where my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and others have been, and have had ſome kind of Diſcourſe, which was not Treaſon, but rather a thing that I ever abhorred, and declared a deteſtation of: ſince theſe hurly burlys, concerning Parliaments going off, and coming on, did diſcontent the people upon one account or another, I confeſs I have been a hearer, and have underſtood too much of ſome kind of meetings, which I pray God forgive them for, and eſpecially thoſe that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Proteſtants, being 10000 times worſe than any others. That there have been ſuch kind of Deſigns, and Meetings, and Clubbs, I have not been ignorant of; God forgive me that. I have not been as careful and as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and as ready and forward to diſcover it a great while ſince. That I ever had a hand in it, or the leaſt thought or reſolution, or intention to appear in it, but rather, on the contrary, have declared my opinion againſt it both in the ſight of God, and man, as a breach of the Laws of God, and the Laws of the Land, and contrary to our Duty, who are bound to pray for the King, and all that are in Authority. I do declare in the preſence of God, I am a perfect ſtranger, and I thank God my Conſcience is clear, I have acquainted his Majeſty in Council, and I have had the Honour to be admitted into his Majeſties preſence in private almoſt half an hour on <hi>Saturday</hi> was ſeven-night, where I was as clear and above board, and as faithful to his Majeſty as I could be in an humble manner, according to my duty; where I offered to have ſome time, and place allotted, that I might give him a whole Scheme of the buſineſs: For there were a great many Gentlemen that had a reſpect for me; It was their opinions that I had a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Knowledge of all the Clubbs, and all the Deſigns that ever were ſince the King came in, but they were under a miſtake. I gave his Majeſty an account to the beſt of my knowledge, and when I had done, his Majeſty ſeemed to be pleaſed, and to thank me for it; but before I had power to put it in writing, and wait upon his Majeſty, the Providence of God did ſo order it, the Council thought it fit that I ſhould be committed to Priſon, where I was ſome days; I have had more kindneſs among <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> I pray God to forgive them for it, I had not liberty to ſend to my Wife big with Child, in two days where I was.</p>
               <p>Sir, I ſhall not hold you in ſuſpence, and multiply words, but what is moſt proper to this occaſion. What I have given to his Majeſty in Council, and what I have ſpoken to his Majeſty, in private, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the naked truth to clear my own Conſcience, that I may not go out of the world with any thing upon me: I wiſh thoſe that call themſelves Proteſtants would diſcharge their duty better to God and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99753:4"/>the King, than either I or the beſt Subject ever did. I have lookt upon't as an obligation ever ſince I knew what it was to be a man, to carry my ſelf obedient to thoſe that God has ſet over me, eſpecially the King and thoſe that are in Authority; and I have made it my practice to pray for the King, as for my own ſoul. That it has been my lot to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with thoſe vanities of Clubbs, and perſons, no rational man will wonder, conſidering the Circumſtances and places I was called to. There is one particular Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Sheriff;</hi> I muſt deſire the favour to clear my ſelf by ſomething that I took occaſion to ſpeak of yeſterday. I did acquaint you, Mr. <hi>Sheriff,</hi> with what I had ſpoken to the King, how I was interrupted in the further diſcovery of what I had a mind to ſay. What was further ſaid yeſterday, it was nothing but the naked truth: In the firſt place, as to what was afterwards diſcourſt of, as to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, namely and particularly Sir <hi>Thomas Player,</hi> I muſt do juſtice to all the world. That he hath been acquainted with the Lord <hi>Shaftabury,</hi> none, here, will wonden; but that he hath been very ſhy of his Company ſince he came out of the <hi>Tower:</hi> for he told me many times, he never was in his company but once, for he did not like ſome things, and ſaw ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns that he was afraid were going on; and thereupon Sir <hi>Thomas Player</hi> was ſo ingenuous and honeſt to the King, as to break off. I always look'd upon him as a very Loyal ſubject, and I muſt declare in the preſence of God and all theſe people, I never heard him ſpeak one diſhonourable word of the King; what he may have had with others is beſt known to himſelf. I have been in ſeveral Clubbs eating and drinking, where it has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſt to accommodate the Kings Son, the D. <hi>M.</hi> That there was a deſign to ſet up the D. of <hi>M.</hi> I will not ſay while the King raigns, though ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant hot-headed men have taken upon them to diſcourſe theſe things, but not any worthy man: I know thoſe that were worthy to be called by that name, have declared in my hearing, that in oppoſition to the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> if the King be ſeiſed, they would ſtand by the D. of <hi>M.</hi> There are others, (I will not give nicknames to any, you are wiſe men, and know what I mean by ſpeaking in the general,) that were for a Common-wealth, and ſome there were, two or three perſons. I ſhall be as plain as I can, and I hope you will bear with me ſince it came to my lot to come to the knowledge of it. Some were for the D. of <hi>M.</hi> ſome for a Commonwealth, and ſome, but very few, not worth naming, were for the D. of <hi>Bucks:</hi> But that I think fell at laſt between theſe two, being the greater part, as far as I did apprehend by diſcourſing here and there in the City, which I did very frequently do. But the way of theſe Gentlemens diſcourſing theſe things was only one at a time, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially a very induſtrious Gentleman that hath made it his practice a long time, (for it hath been my lot to be acquainted but two months and that too long,) which is the Witneſs that comes againſt me, and I pray God to forgive him, and I blame him not for diſcovering me, but for the words he ſpake himſelf, by way of inſtigating me to enter into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt the King; they were his own words and not mine. I blame him not for diſcovering any thing whereby the King may be ſerved. He did tell me ſeveral times there were Clubbs in <hi>London,</hi> but I could never get out of him the places where the Clubbs were. Yet I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured what poſſibly I could to come to the bottom of that deſign for my intent was to make a faithful and true diſcovery, that I might not go to <hi>Whitehall</hi> or a Juſtice of Peace, with an idle ſtory, or a ſham: but at laſt I got out of him that <hi>Rich. Goodenough</hi> was chiefly inſtrumental. This was a very few days before notice was given, this certain perſon <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Lee</hi> the <hi>Dyer,</hi> that he was ſworn againſt by one <hi>How:</hi> I asked him the meaning. He told me that that <hi>How</hi> was a very Rascal. I asked <hi>Lee,</hi> Sir, what courſe ſhall be taken? for what by the <hi>Doctors-Commons</hi> of the one hand, and what by the perſecutions of the other, we muſt think of a way how to relieve it. There is ſome deſign in hand, ſays <hi>Lee,</hi> don't you know? no, ſaid I, I would be glad to hear.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99753:5"/>There is an invaſion, ſaid he, going on, a deſign againſt the King and the Government, but that was only a fallacy; but he diſcovered after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to me that there was a reſolution, and a certain number of people about the City and the Nation, to make an attack upon the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> upon the City of <hi>London,</hi> upon <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and upon St. <hi>James</hi>'s: I ſaid what do you deſign then? have a care that you don't ſhed more innocent blood, for the Land is ſtained with blood too much already. No, ſaith he, the reſolution as Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> ſaith, is not to ſpill a drop of blood, but only to ſecure the Kings perſon, that the Papiſts do not kill him, and then ſaith he we will deal with the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> as we pleaſe. They were his own words to the beſt of my remembrance. Afterwards this Gentleman was ſworn againſt by one Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> in <hi>Eaſt-Smithfield,</hi> ſaith he, he's a Rogue and a Dog, and I have ſeen him but once theſe nine Months, and I had no diſcourſe but only drunk a glaſs of drink; which proves ſince to the contrary. Being then in Company at the <hi>Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head Tavern</hi> in <hi>Swithens-Ally</hi> near the <hi>Exchange,</hi> news was brought, he was ſworn againſt, he did not know what to do, but found out a place near <hi>London-wall,</hi> and deſired me to go to one or two about the matter, he knew not how to obſcure himſelf, his houſe was beſet, Meſſengers after him, and likewiſe a kind of Judgment or Execution; how to put both ends together he knew not. I told him, if he would I had a bed, he might go to my houſe. I never heard a word from <hi>Rich. Goodenough</hi> one way nor another of any deſign againſt the K. and the Government, whom I have known this ſeven years; only this <hi>Lee</hi> told me, his hand was as deep as any other. Its true, this Gentleman comes and ſwears againſt me, that I ſhould be the only perſon to ingage in taking the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London.</hi> Sir <hi>John</hi> — you know very well in what capacity I have been, and how very uncapable I was in my perſon to take the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London.</hi> I ſpeak in the preſence of God, before whom I am to appear in a few minutes, I never had any ſuch thought, never had any ſuch deſire, never conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with any perſons of Quality, never diſcourſed of any Arms in order to it, but only this I was ſaying. This fellow being ſet on (and I think a more proper perſon than any man in the world) for that he was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle low in the world, he was under a temptation of being thrown out by an <hi>Anabaptiſtical Church,</hi> for ſome kind of failings, he was under a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to make himſelf ſomebody, therefore he did cloſe with Mr. <hi>Geode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi> and ſome others; and when the firſt Proclamation came forth, he himſelf told me, I never knew it before, that <hi>Rumſey,</hi> Captain <hi>Waicot, Nelthrop</hi> and <hi>Goodenough</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> were concerned in this deſign, he was the man told me: and when the ſecond Proclamation came out, then he could tell me of thoſe too; I told him he was a wretch he had not diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it betimes; as to his ſwearing againſt me, for which God forgive him, that I had a hand in taking the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> the thing is this: He knew I was intimately acquainted with a certain Captain, one <hi>Blage,</hi> who was my ſervant 21 years ago in <hi>Virginia;</hi> he hath been a very faithful and honeſt ſervant, I believe, to his Majeſty for theſe 15 years, particularly five years in three of his Majeſties Men of War. I know very well the man is of ſuch a principle that he abhors to ingage in any wicked deſign. But only <hi>Lee</hi> diſcourſing at random about taking the <hi>Tower,</hi> Captain <hi>Blage</hi> gave this anſwer, (for he is a very jocular man,) if I were of a mind to take it, were it for the ſervice of the King, if there were an enemy coming in, ſaith he, I would with ſix Ships well manned and armed with Guns undertake to take the <hi>Tower:</hi> upon what account he ſaid it, I don't know, but I believe in my Conſcience he had no more deſign to put ſuch a thing in practice, than I have to cut my own throat at preſent; Captain <hi>Blage</hi> had heard theſe diſcourſes <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> ſaith he 2 or 300 men would do it, it's weak in ſuch a place, I wonder his Majeſty dos not make it ſtronger. Now when he came to ſwear, as ſoon as he was taken up, he took occaſion to ſwear againſt me, all the diſcourſe he uſed in preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing me to undertake this deſign.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheriff, I have nothing at all to ſay, either to blame the Judges, or the Jury, or the Witneſſes themſelves, the greateſt of all. I thank God I was not any way to have had any hand in it: but the very words themſelves that came out of his mouth he makes me the Author of, but I freely forgive him, as I deſire God would forgive me: tho he did tell me poſitively there were five hundred Arms to be brought out of the Countrey. I heard of ſuch a thing, I confeſs, here and there, but could never know the Authors of it, nor the Clubbs where it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed: it was lately that he told me, <hi>Goodenough</hi> told him, That the King was to be taken off as he came from <hi>Windſor,</hi> That there was ſeveral things to be done in order to it, That they wanted a place of meeting, and ſome thought of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Plain,</hi> and ſome of <hi>Black Heath,</hi> but the moſt convenient place pitched upon was <hi>Black Health.</hi> They were diſcourſing how to gather the People together; Some were for communicating it privately, others for a Ball. They asked my Thoughts: ſaid I, the beſt way will be, if you throw up a Silver Ball, to get the People to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: for my deſign was to get what I could out of them. Thereupon he went to Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and diſcours'd him, and told him, that my Opinion was, to throw up a Silver Ball and declare, All thoſe that will come and drink a Bowl of Punch, ſhall be welcome, and that by this means they would have gathered thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or forty thouſand men in two or three dayes time, which otherwiſe would have been a fortnight a doing: but for himſelf, I will not blame him, nor lay any thing to his charge of which he is not guilty.

I do not remember that ever he inſiſted upon ſhedding of Blood, but that he hath diſcourſed in very opprobrious terms and baſe Language of the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> by calling him Rogue, and Dog, and ſuch things: and that <hi>We will do his work:</hi> That is true. And, that after the King's deceaſe, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> having a Vogue with the People, muſt of neceſſity ſucceed: I cannot tell what I can ſay more as to that; that is the chief thing I have to ſay, if I have not forgot any thing.</p>

So he came to me afterwards, and ſaid, that he had diſcourſed with Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> told him, that there was forty thouſand pound in Bank, and if ſuch a Ball coſt thirty or forty pound, it mattered not, to carry on ſuch a Deſign as that was.</p>

               <p>No Sir, I don't deſire it. Mr. Sheriff, I do freely acknowledge and confeſs that it is juſt in God in the firſt place, and righteous and juſt in the King, that I die; and that I die juſtly for concealing it. I would lay no blame upon the King nor any other Perſon in the World. I did not conceal it upon any Account to his Majeſty's Prejudice nor any Man in the Nation; and I hope God will give more Grace to thoſe Perſons that do ſucceed. I beg a Word or two I had almoſt forgot, as a Man and as a Chriſtian, That it is a thing of ſuch evil Conſequence, I have found it by bitter Experience now, for ſuch and ſuch publick Places to be viſited, eſpecially by thoſe that are Profeſſors of the Proteſtant Religion, and particularly Coffee-Houſes, where it is very well known too much time is ſpent, and Families, and Wives, and Children, ſuffer too much: I pray God the People may take notice of it and lay it to Heart that ſpend their time ſo, thinking it is but a Penny and a Penny; and ſo diſcourſe of State-Affairs as if ſo be they were Gods Counſellors in the Government of the World, running from the Coffee-Houſe to the Tavern and from the Tavern to the Coffee-Houſe, which hath been the Debauchery of this Age; and ſo bring them into this <hi>Dilemma</hi> to diſcourſe of thoſe Things neither pleaſing to God nor the King, nor themſelves, but their Prejudice. The Profanation of the Sabbath-Day is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly diſcourſt of in this place; God forgive me for not obſerving it as I ſhould. I pray God thoſe that follow me may be more careful of their Duty to God and Man, for the good of themſelves, their Souls, and their Families; thoſe that are young eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially and coming up, that they may chiefly mind their Concerns for Eternity, and that they would pay their Duty and Homage to the King and thoſe that God has ſet over them, and not neglect that great Command to pray for the King and all that are in Authority.</p>

                  <hi>O</hi> Lord, our God, Thou art the God of preſent help in time of Trouble, a God, that haſt promiſed to be with thy People in the Fire and in the Water. O Lord, we pray thee, that thou wilt afford thy preſence to thy poor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Servants at this time, that thou wilt enable us to pray with Faith, to truſt in thee, to be in expectation and hope of Mercy from thee. O Lord, thy Servant that ſpeaketh doth confeſs, that the Iniquities at his heets have juſtly overtaken him that juſt and righteous art thou in all thy Judgments, that he hath reaſon to bear thy Indignation, becauſe he hath ſinned. O Lord, we beg, even for thy Son Chriſt Jeſus's ſake, that our ſins may not be brought to our remembrance in order to our deſpondency or diſcouragement, or our deſpairing in thy Mercy, but rather, O Lord, in order to an aſſurance that our great God hath pardoned and forgiven them in the Blood of his Son. O do thou hath each of our Souls in that Fountain ſet open for Sin and for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs. Give us, O Lord, inward Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtrength from thy ſelf, and give us cauſe to bleſs thy Name for inward ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Graces, for inward aſſiſtances. O let us find an increaſe of ſpiritual ſtrongth, let us be aſſured that our Sins are done away, and let us alſo be aſſured that our Names are written in the Book of Life, and let it be ſuch an aſſurance as may be matter of joy and rejoycing to our Souls. O do thou enable every one of us, from the inward evidence of thy Spirit, to ſay with thy Servant <hi>Job,</hi> That we know and are aſſured that our Redeemer lives. O do thou give us ſuch an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of an Intereſt in thee, that we may be inabled in deed, in reality, and in truth, to ſay, that we have run our race, and we have finiſhed our courſe with Joy: O let us now receive the fruit of thoſe many Petitions that we have put up unto thee. O let us now find the Spirit influencing our Hearts to a yielding pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and a thorow ſubjection to the Will of God: let us find thy Spirit aſſuring us that we are thine. O let us have ſtronger Evidences of thy Love, ſtronger Teſtimonies of thy Affection: O give us ſome inward Taſtes of thoſe heavenly Joys that we hope through the Mercy of Jeſus Christ in a little time to have a more full Fruition of. O Lord, do thou ſpeak peace to every one of our Conſciences; enable us to take hold of thy Strength that thou may'st make Peace with us, and let us not be diſcouraged, O Lord, ſince we have a High-Priest that can be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with our Infirmities: let us with Boldness have Acceſs to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy and Grace to help in time of need. O take away the Sting and Terror that is in Death in any one of us, by aſſuring us of our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in thee, by aſſuring us that our Names are recorded in the Book of Life; tho we lye under a Sentence of Death from Man, we beg that we may have a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Life eternal from our God; and tho we meet thee, O Lord, in a Field of Blood, we beg that thou wilt come to meet with us in a Field of Mercy. O Lord extend thy Mercy, thou Lord whoſe Compaſſions faileth not, cauſe the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of thy tender pity to yearn with Compaſſion towards us: enable every one of us, O Lord, to die believing in Jeſus Chriſt, to die hoping in his Mercy, to die, relying upon him for Juſtification, for Sanctification, and for Adoption. O Lord, though we have been Prodigals, we deſire to return to our Fathers Houſe where there is Bread enough. O enable us to come unto thee as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99753:7"/>to their Parents. O let our Prayers be offer'd with ſo much Fervour in Christ Jeſus; that thou may'ſt think it reaſonable to aſſure us of thy Love. O let the Interceſſion of Jeſus Christ be accepted. O Lord, we beg that he may be our Advocate; if our Advocate be our Judge, certainly we cannot miſcarry. O let Jeſus Chriſt be the Hope of every one of our Souls; and Lord let not our Hope be like that of the Hypocrite, but let our Faith be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rock of Ages, and let us not fail from the apprehenſion of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Puniſhment from men. Yet, O Lord, do thou ſo order our Hearts and our Spirits aright, that thou may'ſt be the Lot of our Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and our Portion for ever. O do thou interest us in thy ſelf; Lord carry on thy own Work. We deſire to come unto thee that we may have life. Lord help us, Lord put to thy helping Hand, Lord teach us truly to leave no Sin unrepented of in any one of our Hearts. And O Lord, we beg that with us thou wilt give us leave to recommend unto thy Care our poor Wives and Children: Thou haſt promiſed to be the Father of the Fatherleſs and the Husband of the Widdow; and thou hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to caſt the Care of them upon thee. O do thou make Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for them, deal kindly with them, imprint thy own Image upon them, and enable them to bear this ſevere ſtroke with Patience. O Lord, ſtand by and ſupport them; let their Ways be found ſo pleaſing and acceptable unto thee, that thou may'ſt think it reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to make all their Enemies at Peace.

O Lord, we alſo beſeech thee in the behalf of theſe poor King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms wherein we are, that thou wilt be merciful to them, prevent Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among them, heal all their Breaches, compoſe their Differences, make all that are thine of one Heart and Mind in the things of thee our God. And Lord, if it be thy Will, do thou rule in the Heart of the King, that he may rule and reign for thee, and for the good of thy Church and people. Lord, favour us with thy mercy, aſſure us of thy love, ſtand by us in the difficult hour, take us into thine own Care, cauſe thy Angels to attend us, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey our Souls as ſoon as they are divided from our Bodies, into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, into the Paradice of our God. And Lord, we beg that thou wilt be with us, with thy extraordinary Preſence, helping us to truſt in thee, doing for us beyond what our narrow Hearts are able to ask or think. All which we beg for the ſake of thy Son Jeſus Chriſt, in whom, O Lord, this little time do thou give us Hearts to give thee all Glory, Honour, and Praiſe, now and for evermore. <hi>Amen. Sweet Jeſus, Amen.</hi>

               <p>GLorious Lord our God, thou art the God of the whole Creation, and the God that created the Heavens and the Earth in ſix days; by thy power we ſtand here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee: Lord, help us to be looking up unto Jeſus Chriſt, who is exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour to give Repentance to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Remiſſion of ſins. Now, Lord, for thy mercies ſake we would be helped to ſay, That Power that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, that is able to raiſe up our poor Souls before thee from Death to Life. O Lord, for thy mercies ſake waſh all our Souls in the Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>which ſpeaketh better things than that of Abel:</hi> and, Lord, for thy mercies ſake pardon all our ſins, from our firſt, our Original ſins, and our ſins of Sabbath-breaking, and our ſins of Tranſgreſſion, and the ſin for which we are condemn'd; O Lord, pardon it, and let us not go out of the World with one ſin hid in our Souls. For thy mercies ſake pardon all our ſins; and, Lord, do thou preſerve this Nation, and put it into the heart of the King to be merciful, and to rule in Truth and Righteouſneſs. And for thy mercies ſake, rule the Affairs of this Nation, and help to rule and govern all things for the government of our Souls and our Spirits, for thy mercies ſake; and help us that with joy we may be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Glory, into the eternal Habitations: for Chriſt is ſent into the World to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to ſave ſinners, of whom we are chief. And, Lord, for thy mercies ſake, let me have a true belief in Jeſus Chriſt aright, to be looking up unto him for Life and for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Oh that we might periſh if we periſh, and be found doing thy will to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of our power. Lord, accept of us, and help us and be with us this little time we ſhall be in this world. All which we beg for the ſake of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be Glory with the Kingdom both now and for evermore.</p>

               <p>O Lord our God, who art nearer to each and every one of us, than we are to our ſelves: It is not all the Confeſſions to men in the world, were it confeſſed by the Tongues of Angels, thoſe glorious Spirits above, that can avail any thing with the great God, againſt whom we have ſinned, or that can procure pardon for the leaſt tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which deſerves eternal wrath. And therefore for the Sins that we have been guilty of, either againſt the firſt or the ſecond Table, either againſt God as our Creator, Chriſt as our Redeemer, or the Holy and Bleſſed Spirit as our Sanctifier, the ſins that we have committed againſt thy holy Church, and that Faith that I hope we die in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of, the ſins that we have been guilty of againſt our Neighbours, upon one account and another, the ſins that we have been guilty of againſt our Governours and Rulers, to whom thou haſt obliged us under manifold obligations, both as Men and Chriſtians, the ſins that we have been guilty of in our ſeveral places, Relations and Capacities what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, whatever have been their Circumſtances and their Aggravations, the leaſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of deſerves everlaſting death, without the Merits of Jeſus; for all thoſe greater or leſſer ſins, whether that original ſin we brought into the world with us, that ſource and fountain, and foundation of all other ſins, thoſe actual ſins and tranſgreſſions againſt any of thoſe that thou haſt ſet over us, or thoſe that have been equal with us; thoſe relation-ſins, as Husband and Wife, as Maſter and Servant, in every relation and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; Lord forgive them, and waſh them away in the blood of the Lamb of God, that ſtands at the right hand of the Majeſty on high. And becauſe we have no worthineſs of our own to recommend us to thee, therefore we beg thee for thy Sons ſake to fetch arguments from thy ſelf. Our righteouſneſs is as filthy rags, and the beſt of us are as a menſtruous cloath. Fetch Arguments from the riches of thy grace, from the goodneſs of thy nature, from the multitude of thy mercies, from the blood of thy Son, from
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99753:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>that bleſſed, eternal interceſſion that we hope he is making for us, and for all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the election of Grace, and ſhall be brought to glory. Remember thy Churches, haſten the fulfilling of thy promiſes, the accompliſhing of thy propheſies through the world, the downfal of the man of ſin, and the deſtruction of all thy true Churches implacable enemies. Lord haſten the day of the calling the Jews, and the fulneſs of the Gentiles; put an end to Wars and rumours of Wars, let the deſire of all Nations come. Dwell in theſe Three Nations, be a wall of fire round about them; prevent any kind of Inſurrection at home, all manner of Invaſion from abroad; let thoſe that tarry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, enjoy peace, and truth, and righteouſneſs. Dwell in and reign in the heart of the King, Lord bleſs and proſper him in his Perſon, give him a long, a proſperous, and an happy Reign. Good Father we pray thee, let him live here with a flouriſhing Crown upon his head, till thou in thy due time ſhalt receive him to an eternal Crown hereafter. Bleſs him in his Royal Family and Relations, in his Royal Brother. Bleſs him in his Royal Conſort, make the King a Nurſing Father, and the Queen a Nurſing Mother. Confound all hatred, malice and envy, all evil ſpeaking, every thing that is contrary to ſound Doctrine, and give thy people that live under him, to ſhew that dutifulneſs and reſpect as becomes Chriſtians, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s becomes Loyal Subjects. Bleſs the Clergy, by whatſoever Names or Titles diſtinguiſhed, make them ſound in their Doctrine, and make them uſeful and unblameable in their Lives and Converſations. Help them to mind the Souls committed to their charge, and help them to do their duty, that they may be able to ſay, behold here are we and the Children whom thou haſt given us. Now Lord bleſs all the Nation from the higheſt to the loweſt, from the Prince to the Peaſant, of all ſorts, ranks and degrees. Give Loyalty towards our dread Sovereign, who is a merciful and gracious Prince, whom thou haſt ſet as thy Vicegerent to Reign over us, who can do nothing but what is juſt and equal before thee, to whom he muſt give an account of all his Tranſactions, even to thee the King of Kings. And Lord grant peace and love and unity one among another, and the practical obſervation of thy holy day, and thoſe duties that relate to God and Man. Grant that thoſe that follow after us, may take particular Example by us. We muſt needs acknowledge and ſmite upon our thighs, that we in Juſtice are brought hither, that we have nothing to do, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn our ſelves, and juſtifie the Juſtice of the Land, and to pray God to bleſs his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to Reign in theſe Nations, and thoſe that ſhall ſucceed him upon the Throne. All which we beg upon the account of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who was dead and behold he lives, to whom with thy ſelf and eternal Spirit, we deſire to aſcribe, as is due, all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, praiſe, and glory everlaſting.
